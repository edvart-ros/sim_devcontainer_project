project where i attempt to get a ros workspace and gazebo simulator (with gzweb) working.
With this we'll help new people get started with ros and gazebo without needing a dedicated ubuntu machine locally.



- clone repo
- create ros workspace
- vrx_navier exists in the repo ~~clone vrx_navier into workspace~~
- make
- launch simlation headless and visualize in browser
